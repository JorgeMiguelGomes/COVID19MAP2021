# COVID19MAP2021
An animated scatter map
 
## WHAT YOU WILL NEED 
**Python**	
pandas + plotly + plotly.io 


**MAPBOX**
You will need a Mapbox token that you can get from Mapbox
This token should be stored in a config.py file 
**DO NOT FORGET TO ADD config.py to .gitignore or your token will be public**
The confif.py file has the following:

mapbox_token="your token here"

## NEXT STEPS

Write a blog post about the process. This file will be updated as soon as that is done.
